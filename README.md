These presets are Only tested on a monitor resolution of 2560x1440

To make the lower resolution shaders (240P) display correctly RetroArch(or any emulator) integer scaling needs to be switched ON ( Settings>video>scaling). I also recommend trying RetroArch shaders underneath such as "/xbr/super-xbr-fast.slangp" (Set Input and Output gamma to 1.0 in shader parameters) and "/cubic/catmull-rom-fast.slangp". In case those aren't available I suggest enabling Gaussian blur.

#1 To use this you need Reshade, download the latest version here: https://reshade.me/

#2 Open the .exe and follow the instructions, after chosing the graphics API you can skip the remaining steps.

#3 Copy the contents of this zip file to the game or emulator's executable.
